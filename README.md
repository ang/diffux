Diffux can generate visual diffs of web pages, allowing you to spot changes and
style regressions more easily.

## Installing

Diffux requires:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Ruby 2.0.0+

### Mac OS X (Using Homebrew)

Below are some example installation instructions that might help you get Diffux
up and running on Mac OS X using Homebrew.

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/trotzig/diffux.git
cd diffux

# install postgres
brew update
brew doctor
brew install postgresql

# install redis
brew install redis

# install gems
bundle install

# start postgres
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start

# start redis
redis-server

# create tables, load the schema, and run migrations
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

## Running the server

Diffux is a [Rails] app, so if you are familiar with that web framework the
following should be fairly straightforward.

```bash
bundle exec rails s
```

[Rails] runs on port 3000 by default, so you should be able to fire up your
browser with the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Running a worker

Snapshot creation and comparing is handled asynchronously, through [Sidekiq]
workers. To start a worker, run:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```
